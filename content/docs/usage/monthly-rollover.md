# Monthly rollover

## 1. Perform a weekly balance
Go to the Balance sheet and perform a weekly balance to ensure all numbers are up to date.

## 2. Create a spreadsheet for the new month
Make a new copy of your "Monthly Budget Template" spreadsheet

## 3. Copy carryover balances into the new sheet
For subsequent months, copy the bordered region in rows 37–56 below in the old sheet into the new sheet in rows 10–28

## 4. Allocate a monthly budget
Finally, you can allocate your available funds into your budget categories for use this month.
Go to _Allocations_ sheet to do this.

![Allocation sheet](/images/budget-allocation.png)

The green box at the top shows you beginning available funds, which you can allocate to your budget categories.
Column D lists the carried-over balance for each category.
Rounded values are shown here, but it is still tracking pennies behind the scenes.

Enter the amounts you want to add to each category in Column C.
As you do, the remaining amount not allocated will update at the bottom.
It's okay to leave a little behind here; it will simply carry over into the next month, or remain available to allocate later during a mid-month adjustment.

Now you're done and ready for a new month! Be sure to [track your purchases](/docs/usage/expense-entry) as you make them.

## Mid-month adjustment
If you need to make changes later, you can always do so in the gray table on the right side of the _Allocations_ sheet.
Allocate more money to a category by entering an amount and selecting the category.
This will pull from any unallocated funds (thereby reducing the amount available the following month).

To compensate for this, you can pull money from another category at the same time.
Enter a negative amount to do this.

Adjustments will show in the "Additional" column to the left, adding to the remaining amount for the relevant categories.
