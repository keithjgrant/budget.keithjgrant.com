# The philosophy behind this

Your money is not going to take care of itself.
If you've tried Mint or any of those other finance apps, you've probably seen this.

In fact, there's only one finance app I'd recommend to people: [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/features/).
Their approach makes sense — but you don't need to pay for an app to do it.
That's why I created this spreadsheet for myself in the first place.
It's on Google Sheets, so I can access it online and share access with my wife.

Here are the key points:

* Allocate your available money to budgets (bills, groceries, etc).
* You've set a budget, but it's ok if things don't go according to plan; adjust mid-month how you need.
* Live off last month's income, so you're not up the creek if your paycheck falls on a weird day of the month.
* Set aside money ahead of time for vacations, car repair, or holiday spending — this system is designed to handle those irregular, big expenses.

If you want more fancy marketing jargon and colorful images behind this, check out YNAB's [four rules](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/).
I completely endorse them.

I do not dictate how you budget your money, nor which accounts you use to make purchases.
Use your debit card or earn fly miles or just withdraw cash — use what works for you.
